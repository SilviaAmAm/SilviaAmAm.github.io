As a computational chemist starting out in software development, these are some tricks that I wish I had known before.

## Git hooks 

#### What does it do
[Git hooks](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks) let you to run custom scripts before/after important actions. For example, before you  commit some changes. 

#### Why is it useful
I am finding it useful for those python projects where the code needs to be formatted with [black](https://pypi.org/project/black/), [isort](https://pypi.org/project/isort/) and [flake8](https://pypi.org/project/flake8/) before it is allowed to be merged in the main branch. With git hooks, it is possible to run automatically all these tools on any files that will be committed. This prevents me from committing files where I forgot to format the code appropriately!  

#### Example use
Within a git repository, there is a `.git/hooks/` directory.
In this directory there are already some template scripts. I copied the `pre-commit.sample`template and renamed it to `pre-commit` (the name is important!). Then, I modified it to:

{% highlight bash %}
#!/bin/sh
# Run Black and iSort on all python files that are being that are being commited
python_files=$(git status --short | grep -E '^(A|M)' | awk '{ print $2 }' | grep -E '\.py$')

python .git/hooks/pre-commit.py $python_files

if [ $? -eq 1 ]; then
        exit 1
fi

echo -e "No reformatted files! ðŸŽ‰"
{% endhighlight %}



This shell script extracts all the names of the python files that have been staged. It then calls a `pre-commit.py` script an all these files. The `pre-commit.py` script is as follows:

{% highlight python %}
import subprocess
import sysi

files_to_format = sys.argv[1:]
formatting_changes = False

for f_to_format in files_to_format:
    black_output = subprocess.run(["path/to/black", f_to_format], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
    isort_output = subprocess.run(["path/to/isort", f_to_format], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)

    if "reformatted" in black_output.stderr.decode('utf-8') or "Fixing" in isort_output.stdout.decode('utf-8'):
        print(f"Reformatted {f_to_format}")
        formatting_changes = True

if formatting_changes:
    print("Formatted some files. Git add them and then recommit")
    sys.exit(1)
{% endhighlight %}

This runs `black` and `isort` on all the files passed by the shell script. If files are reformatted, the commit is aborted. The files need to be staged again and then recommitted. Otherwise, they are commited as usual.


## pip install -e

#### What does it do
The `-e` option installs a python package in editable mode, either from a local path or from a version control system URL.

#### Why is it useful
This is useful whenever you have a project that imports a package that you are actively developing (i.e. constantly modifying). No more making simlinks manually to the edited files or constantly reinstalling the modified package!!
Just `pip install -e <package-path>` once, and code away!


## git pull \-\-rebase

#### What does it do
When you pull from a remote repository, by default the remote branch will be merged in your local branch. With the `--rebase` option, you can instead rebase your local branch onto the remote branch that was fetched (for a nice explanation of the differences between merging and rebasing, go [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing)). 

#### Why is it nice
This will avoid all those merge commits with variations on the message "Merged from remote!".

In addition, if you do `git pull --rebase` often, you can add it to the git configurations so that every time you `git pull`, it automatically rebases instead of merging. To add it to the global .gitconfig file, you can use the following command:

{% highlight bash %}
git config --global pull.rebase true
{% endhighlight %}

Otherwise, to add it only in specific repositories add the following lines to the `.git/config` file:

{% highlight bash %}
[pull]
        rebase = true
{% endhighlight %}


## PyCharm exporting tests

#### What does it do
[PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) lets you export the results of tests to HTML or XML. 

#### Why is it useful
When you have a large test suite, it is useful to store the results of the tests. It helps me keep track of failing tests that I still need to fix.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/useful_tools/pycharm_export.png" width="400"></p>

The HTML file is really nice when viewed in the browser: it marks with green/red tests that have passed/failes, shows the timing of each test and lets you collapse/expand the details (such as the stack trace for each test).
