Here is how I managed to export PDFs with hand-written annotations from the NeoReader app of my Boox Tab Ultra.

1. Tap in the center of the screen. This opens up this menu.
2. Click on the **More** icon.

3. Click on **Embed data**. This embeds the annotations into the PDF.

4. Export the PDF either by clicking on **More** > **Share** or via Boox drop.


*This worked for version `38136-6a1ec45f42f (38136)` of the NeoReader app.*
