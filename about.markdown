I am a student in the final stages of my PhD in machine learning applied to chemistry, where I have mostly focused on:

1. Fitting potential energy surfaces with neural networks
2. Recurrent neural networks combined with reinforcement learning applied to drug design.

Despite coming from a chemistry background, the aspects of my PhD that I enjoyed the most were the software development and learning about Linux while using super-computers and clusters. Consequently, I am now shifting my focus towards the computer science field!

This blog is a collection of things I thought it would be worthwhile writing about :)
