I am a chemist by training who specialised in computational chemistry. After a few years in the field, tinkering with molecular simulations, I realised that what I was _actually_ interested in was not so much the chemistry, but the computers. So, I decided to abandon the roots and I recently started working as a software developer.

This blog is a collection of random things I thought it would be fun writing about :)
